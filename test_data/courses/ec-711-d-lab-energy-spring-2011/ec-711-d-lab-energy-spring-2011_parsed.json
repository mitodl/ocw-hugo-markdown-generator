This trip is entirely optional and not a formal, credit-bearing part of the class, but highly recommended. Students are expected to contribute $500 toward the cost of the trip; if that amount is prohibitive due to a financial hardship, you should make an appointment with Amy Banzaert to discuss.</p>\r\n<p>For the remainder of the class, students will implement projects in conjunction with their community partners in Nicaragua and El Salvador. There will be one formal design review associated with the project; final presentations both in class and then in the group presentations for all <a href=\"http://d-lab.mit.edu/courses\">D-Lab classes</a> at the end of the term.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Credit &amp; Grading</h2>\r\n<p><em>D-Lab Energy</em> is a 12-unit undergraduate class: 3 hours/week in lecture, 3 hours/week in lab, and 6 hours/week on homework, readings, language, and design projects. Your presence and attendance in class is essential: every session will involve in-class activities that are very difficult to replicate or make up outside of class.</p>\r\n<p>This seminar is graded on an A/B/C/D/F basis; furthermore it is a class where your work is impacting the lives of people in Nicaragua and we expect an appropriate level of commitment.</p>\r\n<div class=\"maintabletemplate\">\r\n<table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\">\r\n    <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption>\r\n    <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th scope=\"col\">COURSE&nbsp;WORK</th>\r\n            <th scope=\"col\">GRADE&nbsp;WEIGHTS</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr class=\"row\">\r\n            <td>Course engagement (attendance, participation in both in-class and online activities)</td>\r\n            <td>25%</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr class=\"alt-row\">\r\n            <td>Assignments (readings, homework, labs)</td>\r\n            <td>25%</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr class=\"row\">\r\n            <td>Quizzes</td>\r\n            <td>20%</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr class=\"alt-row\">\r\n            <td>Design project (10% final prototype &amp; report, 10% participation, 10% assignments)</td>\r\n            <td>30%</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2>\r\n<p><a name=\"Polak\"></a>Required text: [Polak] =  Polak, Paul. <em>Out of Poverty: What Works When Traditional Approaches Fail</em>. Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2008. ISBN: 9781576754498</p>\r\n<p>Other readings will be assigned for individual topics and class sessions.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Hablamos Espa\u00f1gles</h2>\r\n<p>Because we will be traveling to Nicaragua and El Salvador over spring break and working with Spanish-speaking community partners, it is important that all students know at least a tiny bit of Spanish. If you don't speak Spanish fluently, you should plan to spend no less than 20 minutes/week working on your Spanish. We recommend <em>Coffee Break Spanish</em>, a free podcast for beginners to intermediate speakers (starting at whatever week seems like it matches your skill), or <em>Show Time Spanish</em>, a free podcast for more advanced speakers. Each show is 15-20 minutes long. 20 minutes/week won't get you very far, so if you can sneak in more, please do so (with the podcast format, it's easy to listen while walking around campus).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, we will speak &quot;Spanglish&quot; in <em>D-Lab Energy</em>. The usage will be very basic and relatively infrequent but will give a taste of Spanish. Students who speak Spanish well are encouraged to help everyone else in the class (including instructors!) improve their Spanish.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Muddy Cards</h2>\r\n<p>After each class, students will submit &quot;muddy cards&quot; to request more discussion or clarification, and to provide frequent and timely feedback to the instructors. This reference gives background about the goals and methodology of using muddy cards:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Worldwide CDIO Initiative. <span class=\"nobr\"><a href=\"http://www.cdio.org/files/mudcards.pdf\"><em>Muddiest Point in the Lecture (Muddy Cards)</em> (PDF)</a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Guidelines for Project Work During 2<sup>nd</sup> Half of Term</h2>\r\n<p>There will be a lot of &quot;free&quot; time in class for project work. You still need to come to class on time and work for the entire time; instructors and mentors will be stopping by regularly to meet with your team and help you. If you will not be working in the classroom, you should leave a note on the classroom whiteboard stating where your team will be and including a cell phone we can use to track you down if need be.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Wiki Design Notebook</h3>\r\n<p>Each week, your team should update your team's Wiki page.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Design Review</h3>\r\n<p>Your design review will include 10 minutes to present your project, and then 15 minutes for discussion and questions. You should bring and demonstrate your working prototype.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Final Presentations</h3>\r\n<p>The final presentation session will consist of three parts: A 1 minute presentation, a poster session, and finally a 20 minutes design review (10 minutes of presentation followed by 10 minutes for discussion). You should bring a working, good-looking prototype for demonstrations.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2>\r\n<h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Part 1: Foundations - Lectures and Labs</h3>\r\n<div class=\"maintabletemplate\">\r\n<table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\">\r\n    <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption>\r\n    <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th scope=\"col\">WEEK&nbsp;#</th>\r\n            <th scope=\"col\">CLASSES</th>\r\n            <th scope=\"col\">LABS</th>\r\n            <th scope=\"col\">ASSIGNMENTS&nbsp;DUE*</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr class=\"row\">\r\n            <td>1</td>\r\n            <td>Lecture 1.

Start by guessing how much more power your legs can produce than your arms.</p> <p>The pumps you will be using have been developed for different applications in the developing world, and are both examples of appropriate technologies. The first of these pumps is the Escuela M\u00f3vil de Agua y Saneamiento (EMAS) pump developed by Wolfgang Buchner in Bolivia. It is a PVC hand pump that uses two one-way valves, and pumps on the down stroke. The second pump is the Full Belly Project Pump that is designed and developed by Jock Brandis, and is a cement rocker pump.</p> <p>We will be estimating the power output by pumping water and calculating the pressure and flow rate of the water. It is important to remember that this is an approximation, as the pumps themselves have different efficiencies. We should start with the definition of power in a system with fluid flow:</p> <p><em>P = p x Q</em></p> <p>where <em>p</em> is pressure (Pa) and <em>Q</em> is the volumetric flow rate (<em>m<sup>3</sup>&frasl;s</em>)</p> <p>For each pump:</p> <ol>     <li>Measure <em>Q</em>:     <p>While we can measure the volumetric flow rate using a variety of sensors, in this lab we will be using five-gallon buckets and measuring the time it takes to fill them using a stopwatch.</p></li>     <li>Measuring <em>p</em>:     <p>We can approximate the pressure of the fluid by using the hydrostatic pressure equation:</p>     <p><em>p = &rho;gh</em></p>     <p>where <em>&rho;</em> is the density of the fluid, <em>g </em>is the gravitation acceleration, and <em>h</em> is the height of the fluid</p></li>     <li>Calculate P     <p>Based on your measurements, calculate the power.</p></li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Water Carrying</h2> <p>Try out all forms of water carrying.

The stock you will have to work from is a 1&quot; x 6&quot; piece of wood that is 8 feet long. In teams of two, you will have to make: one 1&quot; x 6&quot; x 20 cm piece with notches, two 1&quot; x 1&quot; x 30 cm pieces, and one 1&quot; x 1&quot; x 20 cm piece and then drill pilot holes in them.

However, as part of the design process, it is important to consider which tools and techniques our target communities will likely have access to. It would not, for example, be appropriate to have a critical component in your design be something that needs to be waterjet cut (though an experienced metalworker may be able to cut a similar component using a chisel). For both the cutting and drilling parts of the shop intro, discuss the different techniques you were exposed to paying particular attention to:</p> <ol type=\"a\">     <li>The relative difficulty of the process</li>     <li>The speed of the tool</li>     <li>The likely availability in the developing world</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Water Carrying</h2> <p>First, write down your impressions of each method of carrying water.

Since we know that the <em>P = I<sup>2</sup>R = V<sup>2</sup>/R</em>, it is possible to find the maximum power output of the solar panel experimentally by measuring current and voltage at a variety of resistances. The procedure for generating this curve is as follows:</p> <ol>     <li>Choose an orientation for the solar panel     <p>As you will find in the other modules, changing the angle of the solar panel and the amount of light that is contacting the panel will affect the power outputted by the panel.

Note: avoid placing the panel close to shadows, since they will move and potentially block some light from the panel.</p></li>     <li>Measure the power of the cell     <p>A potentiometer is a variable resistor, and we will provide you with a fairly robust one that is able to handle the power being outputted by the panel. The resistance of the potentiometer changes as you turn the dial, so you should turn the dial and measure the resistance.</p>     <p>NOTE: You cannot measure the resistance of the pot while it is hooked up to the circuit, so you have to disconnect it from the circuit before measuring. If you do try to measure the resistance, you will burn out the voltmeter.</p>     <p>For several different resistances (I would like to see you take at least 15 different data points) across the range of the resistor, measure the voltage across the load. You will need to graph power vs resistance later for the lab write-up.</p></li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Angle Optimization</h2> <p>In this module you will be measuring how the power output of the solar panel changes with angle. The power output of the solar panel is determined by the angle of the light hitting the solar cell. For a given load, change the angle of the panel and measure the voltage across the resistor and the angle. Take at least 10 different data points, recording the angle and voltage (make sure you also write down the resistance you are using to calculate power later). We want to see how the power output changes when we angle the solar panel both ways, parallel and perpendicular to the individual solar cells.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Shading Module</h2> <p>In this module, you will examine how the efficiency of the solar panel drops when the solar panel is covered. You will be covering the solar panel in two ways, placing a cover that is perpendicular to the individual cells and then placing a cover that is parallel to them. Measure the exposed surface area and take at least 10 different data points, recording the exposed surface area and output voltage (make sure you also write down the resistance you are using to calculate power later).</p> <p><a href=\"./resolveuid/09983496dbeb7fa69b6e295c146cbe57\">&laquo; Back</a></p>", "url": "/courses/edgerton-center/ec-711-d-lab-energy-spring-2011/energy-storage/lab-2-energy-storage-solar-panel", "short_url": "lab-2-energy-storage-solar-panel", "description": "This page describes the procedures for the solar power output and efficiency lab.", "type": "CourseSection", "is_image_gallery": false, "is_media_gallery": false, "list_in_left_nav": false, "file_location": "https://open-learning-course-data-production.s3.amazonaws.com/ec-711-d-lab-energy-spring-2011/5e001ecb027ee84ad79b0cb04f1b0990_lab-2-energy-storage-solar-panel.html", "bottomtext": ""}, {"order_index": null, "uid": "5e62a2ae6757222a296a99da52f7bade", "parent_uid": "bd09c1cc93fd481d39456e105dc16816", "title": "Lab 2 Writeup Assignment", "short_page_title": "Lab 2 Writeup Assignment", "text": "<p>For each of the modules, provide the following analysis and discussion.

If you want to use powerpoint, send me your presentation by 9 am that morning. You should bring your working prototype and show it working. For teams that will need fire, for example, you should think about whether you want to do your presentation outside, but also have a weather backup, like a video of your prototype working. You should also have a looks-like prototype, either by making your working prototype one that looks like it's supposed to look like, or by making a second prototype. (For example, if you were inventing an iphone, you could have one prototype that was on a laptop that showed all the software functionality of the iphone (works-like), and a metal and glass model that didn't work but showed how it'd look, or you could have the whole iphone all together, depending on how far along you were in your design process. There will be some people at the design review who will be brand new, so as you prepare your presentation, assume a scientific audience with no background on your project or D-Lab Energy whatsoever.<span style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);\"><br /> </span></p><p>A video of the initial design review presentations is on the <a href=\"./resolveuid/cc396362e27aa4169fbb66fd1cb19b76\">Project Results</a> page.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Final Design Review &amp; Presentations (Week 14)</h3> <p>Our final presentations will be part of a Saturday showcase of the projects from all D-Lab classes. Each team will prepare the following:</p> <ol>     <li><strong>One-minute Presentation</strong>. Each team will need to prepare a VERY brief, one-minute oral presentation that describes your prototype and summarizes the key aspects of your design. Your audience for this is non-technical, and this presentation should be engaging and exciting and get people to want to learn more.</li>     <li><strong>Poster Session</strong>. After the presentations your team will host a booth so that people in the audience can come to ask you questions about your final prototype. For your booth you should have a working prototype and you should prepare up to two 20'x30' posters for display that help describe the problem and your solution. Engaging posters and hands-on activities for the general public are ideal.</li>     <li><strong>Final Design Review</strong>. During the poster session, your team will break off for a bit for your final design review presentation. At this presentation, you'll have 10 minutes to present your project, and then 10 minutes for discussion and questions (20 minutes total). You should bring a working, good-looking prototype and show it working. For teams that can't demonstrate it working in a classroom because of fire issues or something, show a video for the working aspect. In this case, your prototype should be at full on iPhone version, not split into a &quot;looks like&quot; and &quot;works like.&quot; There will be some people at the design review who will be brand new, so as you prepare your presentation, assume a scientific audience with no background on your project or D-Lab Energy whatsoever.<span style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);\"><br />     </span></li></ol><p>A video of the final design review presentations is on the <a href=\"./resolveuid/cc396362e27aa4169fbb66fd1cb19b76\">Project Results</a> page.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Final Report</h3> <p>The final report (one per team) is due at noon on our final class day, along with a teamwork survey (one per person).</p> <p>The purpose of the final report is to document your project so that community partners and/or future students interested in your work can understand it, avoid repetition, and make further progress. As a team, write a 12-15 page report describing your project. In it you should include:</p> <ul>     <li>An abstract, summarizing your work (about 150 words) and a single, representative photo for the project.</li>     <li>The problem statement, including information about your community partners.</li>     <li>The design specifications you developed and reasons for them.</li>     <li>A brief review of the design concepts you considered and the reasons why you selected your final design.</li>     <li>A detailed description of your design, including reasons for your design decisions. Include pictures, drawings, and calculations as needed to fully describe your design such that an outside party could both fully operate your product and create replicas. An appendix with an instruction manual is appropriate.</li>     <li>Methodologies and results of tests you performed in designing and refining your prototype.</li>     <li>Discuss the extent to which your final design meets the design specifications, and if there are shortfalls, indicate how these might be addressed in the future.</li>     <li>How your design has been received by your community partner, what follow up is needed (prototype delivery, etc.), and how that will be achieved. Include any plans your team and/or any members of your team have for moving this project forward beyond the auspices of SP.775.</li> </ul> <p>As always when writing, be sure to cite any references properly and edit carefully.</p><p>Sample final reports can found on the <a href=\"./resolveuid/cc396362e27aa4169fbb66fd1cb19b76\">Project Results</a> page.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Grading Rubrics</h3> <p><a href=\"./resolveuid/16c217375a56941c0f49bf3df639d86d\">Design Project grading rubric used by instructors (PDF)</a></p> <p><a href=\"./resolveuid/90f493cdd582cf2a1cde3aec846fda5a\">Teamwork self-assessment rubric (<img alt=\"This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.\" src=\"/images/inacessible.gif\" />PDF)</a></p>"}, {"order_index": null, "uid": "cc396362e27aa4169fbb66fd1cb19b76", "parent_uid": "b769b31f283dae0eca5f75068d997bdb", "title": "Project Results", "short_page_title": "Project Results", "text": "<h2 class=\"subhead\">2011 Projects</h2> <p>The following projects were developed during the 2011 class.
