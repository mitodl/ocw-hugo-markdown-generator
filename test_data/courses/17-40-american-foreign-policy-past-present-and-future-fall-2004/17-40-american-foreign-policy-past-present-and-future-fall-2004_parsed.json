What caused the United States' past involvement in foreign wars and interventions? Were the results of U.S. policies good or bad? Would other policies have better served the U.S. and/or the wider world? Were the beliefs that guided U.S. policy true or false? If false, what explains these misperceptions? General theories that bear on the causes and consequences of American policy will be applied to explain and evaluate past and present policies.</p> <p>The history of United States foreign policy in the 20th century is covered in detail.

These problems include the war against Al Qaeda and the wider war on terror; Iraq and Saddam Hussein; the Taiwan Straits; the Central African conflicts; and more. What should be the U.S. stance on global environmental and human rights questions?</p> <p>This is a HASS Communications Intensive course, and so helps fulfill the HASS CI requirement. Communications intensive subjects in the humanities, arts, and social sciences require at least 20 pages of writing divided among 3-5 assignments. Of these 3-5 assignments, at least one should be revised and resubmitted. HASS CI subjects further offer students substantial opportunity for oral expression, through presentations, student-led discussions, or class participation. In order to guarantee sufficient attention to student writing and substantial opportunity for oral expression, the maximum number of students per section in a HASS CI subject is 18, except in the case of a subject taught without sections (where the faculty member in charge is the only instructor). In that case, enrollments can rise to 25, if a writing fellow is attached to the subject.</p> <p>This is an undergraduate course but is open to graduate students.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format and Requirements</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Format</h3> <p>Two 1-hour general meetings and one 1-hour discussion section meeting per week.<br /> Grades are based on section participation (15%), two 8-page papers (40%), final exam (30%), and two quizzes (15%). Students must also complete three ungraded response papers that react to class readings or lectures. The five writing assignments will total 20 pages. One of the 8-page papers must be submitted in draft for comments for rewrite. There will be a public speaking exercise in section. Sections will include 10 students or fewer. Thus this course conforms to the mechanical requirements for all HASS communication-intensive courses.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Discussion Sections</h3> <p>Students are expected to complete required readings before section and to attend section regularly. Section attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absence from section will be penalized.</p> <p>Sections will include a public speaking exercise, in the format of &quot;congressional hearings&quot; where you are asked to frame and defend to the group a viewpoint on a foreign policy issue.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><em>Papers</em></h2> <p>Students will write two short ungraded response papers that react to course readings and lectures, and two longer papers on questions arising from the course material. The two response papers each will be two pages long (double-spaced--not 1.5-spaced, please). The longer papers will be 8 pages. One 8-page paper assignment asks you to explain a past case of American conduct--what accounts for American behavior? A second 8-page assignment asks you to evaluate a past American policy: was the policy appropriate, or would another policy have produced better results?</p> <p>The first ungraded response paper is due in the week of class #6, #7; the second is due in the week of class #11, #12. The first 8-page paper is due in class #18. The second is due in class #24.</p> <p>We require that you submit a rough draft of at least one of your 8-page papers before its due date in order to get comments for rewrite from your TA. You are wise to submit both papers to your TA for comments. So please leave yourself time to get comments on drafts of the 8-page papers from your TAs before you submit final drafts.</p> <p>Your two response papers should advance an argument about the reading or lectures. Your argument can dispute argument(s) advanced in the reading or lectures; can concur with argument(s) advanced in the reading or lecture; can assess or explain policies or historical events described in the reading and lectures; or can relate current events in the press today to ideas or events in the readings or lectures. We encourage evaluation of policies or ideas covered in the reading or lecture. Are they right or wrong? Good or bad? Somewhere in your paper--preferably at the beginning--please offer a 1-2 sentence summary of your argument. Both papers should be about two typed pages (double-spaced, with standard one-inch margins on left, right, top and bottom). They will not be graded but are mandatory and must be completed to receive full credit for class participation.</p> <p>Late papers will be penalized unless extensions are granted well in advance of the paper deadline. Extensions will not be granted except in emergency situations.</p> <p>Your papers may be improved by keeping up with current international affairs during the semester. Three publications offer especially excellent coverage: the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Economist</em> (a weekly), and the <em>Far Eastern Economic Review</em> (also a weekly).</p> <p>Your papers and public speaking may also be improved by seeking help fromMIT's Writing and Communications Center. They give good writing advice and have useful practice facilities for public speaking.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quizzes</h3> <p>Two short (15 minute) quizzes will be given in class #9, and class #20. Three short (define-and-identify) questions will be asked on each quiz.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Final Exam</h3> <p>A list of study questions will be circulated before the final. The final exam questions will be drawn from this list. Students are encouraged to study together to prepare their answers. The final will also include short-answer questions that will not be distributed in advance.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><em>Films</em></h2> <p>The 17.40 film society. Two optional evening film-showings will be organized during the term, on topics to be chosen by acclamation of the class, with advice from 17.40 film maven Daniel Landau. Topics could include the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, or other subjects.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Books to Purchase</h2> <p> Paterson, Thomas G., J. Garry Clifford, and Kenneth J. Hagan. <em>American Foreign Relations</em>. Vol. 2: <em>A History Since 1895</em>. 5th ed. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1999.

ISBN: 9780393318340.</p> <p>A book that will improve your papers (also used for another course - 17.432):</p> <p>Turabian, Kate L. <em>A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations</em>. 6th ed. Rev. by John Grossman and Alice Bennett. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996. ISBN: 00226816273.</p> <p>Turabian is not required for 17.40 but you will want to own a copy. She has the basic rules for how to format footnotes, etc. Learn and obey them.</p> <p>Assigned readings average 85 pages per week over 14 weeks. However, note that readings are heavier for some weeks. You should plan ahead and budget your time so you can complete the heavy readings.</p>",

            "text": "<h2 class=\"subhead\">Section Presentations: What They Are</h2> <p>The U.S. Congress often asks experts to present their views on important public policy matters to hearing conducted in Congressional committees. In our sections you will also be asked to testify. As in a real hearing, you will give a short presentation and then you will be questioned by an opinionated and perhaps skeptical panel.</p> <p>Your presentation will last five (5) minutes. If you run over you may be cut off. Your presentation should include (1) an argument, and (2) supporting evidence or reasoning. Your TA and your fellow students will then pose questions and ask you to address counter-arguments. Be prepared to defend your argument with deductive or historical evidence.</p> <p>You choose the topic of your presentation. You can make an argument that reacts to an issue raised in class or in the course readings, or you can address a subject of special concern to you. Your presentation can overlap with your paper topic.</p> <p>We suggest that you bring an outline of your presentation and either hand it out or put it up on the blackboard, to help your audience follow your argument. We also suggest that you summarize your argument in a couple of sentences before marching through it. Again, this makes you easier to follow.</p> <p>We will try to organize presentations so that there are two presenters for each section meeting in which presentations are made, and the two presentations are on the same topic. Things are most exciting if they disagree.</p> <p>We recommend that you practice your speech a couple of times--to the mirror or, better still, to a friend--before giving it. You can also practice using the facilities of&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.mit.edu/writing\">MIT's Writing and Communications Center</a>, and can get helpful advice from their staff.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">First Paper Assignment</h2> <p>Select a major episode in American foreign policy from the following list, and write a short paper that identifies what you believe is the single best explanation for American policies. Please also identify what you believe are the one or two best competing explanations and explain why you find them less compelling. Finally, feel free to identify policy prescriptions that follow from your analysis, if any do. Use historical evidence to support your argument. You may want to draw on one or more theories discussed in this course to construct your explanation but can also rely on other theories.</p> <ol> <li>American entry into and/or conduct of World War I.</li> <li>American entry into and/or conduct of World War II.</li> <li>America's decision to wage the Cold War.</li> <li>The strategies and tactics adopted by the United States in the Cold War.</li> <li>American entry into and/or conduct of the Korean War.</li> <li>American conduct of the War on Terror, 2001-present.</li> </ol> <p>If the facts you need to fully assess your explanations are not found in the available course readings, describe what additional facts you would need to provide a more thorough assessment, and explain why these additional facts would shed light on the questions you address.</p> <p>Note: extra readings, should you wish to consult any, are on reserve at Dewey library. These are denoted in the &quot;further readings&quot; section of your syllabus with a ##. (Extra reading is not mandatory, but we encourage it if your paper seems to call for it.)</p> <p>Your paper should be 8 typed double-spaced pages (with normal 1&quot; margins and normal-size typeface, i.e., 10-12 characters per inch).</p> <p>Remember to start your paper with a short summary introduction that states your question(s) and distills your answer(s).</p> <p>Your paper is due in Class #18 (class time). You can hand it to your TA in class or deliver it to your TA's mailbox.</p> <p>Your TA will give you early feedback on your paper if you submit an outline or rough draft before you submit your final draft. Get moving soon to leave time for this.</p> <p>You are encouraged to consult with each other as you prepare this paper.<br /> Late papers will be penalized unless extensions are granted well in advance of the paper deadline. Extensions will not be granted except in emergency situations.</p> <p>Before writing your papers, please familiarize yourself with the rules of citing sources (handed out in class) and make sure you follow them.</p> <p>Failure to cite sources properly is plagiarism.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Second Paper Assignment</h2> <p>Select an episode in American foreign policy from the following list and write a short paper that evaluates the policy, or a major element of the policy (that is, a major decision or set of decisions, or a major idea or set of ideas). In offering your evaluation please comment on (a) the validity or falsehood of the factual and theoretical assumptions that produced the policy; and/or (b) the results the policy produced - were they those that policymakers sought to produce? Were they good or bad? If you argue that a policy was mistaken, identify the alternative policy that you prefer. You are also invited to identify prescriptions for current policy that follow from your analysis, if any do. Use deductive logic and historical evidence to support your argument.</p> <p>If the evidence available in the assigned readings is too thin to allow you to fully evaluate the policy or policy element that you have chosen to discuss, please say so and describe the information that you would need to perform a more thorough evaluation. Alternately, you might consult one or two works listed in the &quot;further readings&quot; section of the syllabus: those noted with ## are on reserve at Dewey. (Extra reading is not mandatory but we encourage it if your paper seems to call for it.)</p> <ol> <li>U.S. entry into and/or conduct of the Korean War.</li> <li>The national security policies of the Eisenhower Administration (1953-1961).</li> <li>U.S. policies in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.</li> <li>U.S. policies in Indochina, 1945-1975.</li> <li>Any other U.S. intervention in the Third World.</li> <li>The 2001-present War on Terror.</li> <li>Another U.S. foreign policy of your own choosing.</li> </ol> <p>Your paper should be 8 typed double-spaced pages with normal 1&quot; margins and normal-size typeface, i.e., 10-12 characters per inch. Don't forget to start your paper with a short summary introduction that states your question(s) and distills your answer(s).</p> <p>Your paper is due in Class #24 (class time). You can hand it to your TA in class, or deliver it to your TA's mailbox.</p> <p>Your TA will give you early feedback on your paper if you submit an outline or rough draft before you submit your final draft.

Al Qaeda's violence stems from a stream of Islamist thought going back to ibn Taymiyya, a bellicose Islamic thinker from the 13th century; to Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792), the harsh and rigid shaper of modern Saudi Arabian Islam; to Rashid Rida (1866-1935) and Hassan al-Banna (?-1949); and above all to Sayyid Qutb (?-1966), the shaper of modern Islamism. Taymiyya, al-Wahhab and Qutb are covered here. Covered also (pp. 91-94) is the frightening rise of apocalyptic thinking in the Islamic world.

    "description": "\n<p>The mission for this course is to explain and evaluate past and present United States policies. What caused the United States' past involvement in foreign wars and interventions? Were the results of U.S. policies good or bad? Would other policies have better served the U.S. and/or the wider world? Were the beliefs that guided U.S. policy true or false? If false, what explains these misperceptions? General theories that bear on the causes and consequences of American policy will be applied to explain and evaluate past and present policies.</p>\n<p>The history of United States foreign policy in the 20th century is covered in detail. Functional topics are also covered: U.S. military policy, U.S. foreign economic policy, and U.S. policy on human rights and democracy overseas. Finally, we will predict and prescribe for the future. What policies should the U.S. adopt toward current problems and crises? These problems include the war against Al Qaeda and the wider war on terror; Iraq and Saddam Hussein; the Taiwan Straits; the Central African conflicts; and more. What should be the U.S. stance on global environmental and human rights questions?</p>",
