This is an undergraduate course but is open to graduate students.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Description</h2> <p>The mission of this course is to explain and evaluate past and present United States foreign policies. What caused past U.S. involvement in foreign wars and interventions? Were the results of U.S. policies good or bad?\tWould other policies have produced better results? Were the beliefs that guided U.S. policy true or false? If false, what explains these misperceptions?\tGeneral theories that bear on the causes and consequences of U.S. policy are applied to explain and evaluate past and present policies.</p> <p>The course covers&nbsp;foreign policy episodes including U.S. involvement in World Wars I and II, the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Korean and Indochina Wars, the 2003 Iraq war, and the 2001&ndash;present &quot;War on Terror.&quot;\tFunctional topics are also covered: U.S. national security policy, U.S. foreign economic policy, and U.S. policy on human rights and democracy overseas.\tFinally, we predict and prescribe for the future. What policies should the U.S. adopt toward current problems and crises? Problems discussed include threats posed by Al Qaeda and its affiliates, and by ISIS/ISIL/Islamic State; the potential spread of weapons of mass destruction to states and non-state actors; possible threats emanating from Syria, Iran and Iraq; North Korean nuclear weapons; managing China's rise; the Ukraine/Russia conflict; climate change; threats to global public health; human rights; and more.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Communications Intensive Requirement</h2> <p>This is a Communications Intensive (CI) course, and counts toward fulfilling the <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/hassreq/\">HASS-D</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/commreq/\">CI</a> requirements.</p> <p>CI courses, including 17.40, require 20 pages of writing, require early submission of at least one paper, and include two public speaking exercises in section. Sections normally include 10 or fewer students.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format and Requirements</h2> <p><em>Class Format</em></p> <p>The class has two 1-hour general meetings and one 1-hour discussion section meeting per week. Students are expected to complete required readings before each discussion section meeting and to attend section regularly. Section attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absence from section will be penalized.</p> <p>Sections will include a public speaking exercise in the format of mock presentations to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/\">National Security Council (NSC)</a>. You will be asked to frame and defend to the Council a viewpoint on a foreign policy issue.</p> <p><em>Writing Requirement</em></p> <p>Students will write two short ungraded papers&mdash;a response paper that reacts to a course reading or lecture or class discussion, and a paper summarizing your in-section presentation&mdash;and two longer papers on questions arising from the course material. The two ungraded papers each will be two pages long, double spaced. The longer papers will be 8 pages. One 8-page paper assignment asks you to explain a past case of American conduct&mdash;what accounts for American behavior? A second 8-page assignment asks you to evaluate a past American policy: was the policy appropriate, or would another policy have produced better results?</p> <p><em>Quizzes</em></p> <p>Two short (15 minute) quizzes will be given. Quiz dates are Session #9 and Session #20. You will be asked to answer three short (define-and-identify) questions on each quiz.</p> <p><em>Final Exam</em></p> <p>A list of <a href=\"/courses/political-science/17-40-american-foreign-policy-past-present-and-future-fall-2017/exams\">study questions</a> will be circulated before the final. The final exam questions will be drawn from this list. Students are encouraged to study together to prepare their answers. The final will also include short-answer questions that will not be distributed in advance.</p> <p><em>Films</em></p> <p>A couple of optional evening film showings will be organized during the term, on topics to be chosen by acclamation of the class. Topics could include the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, Iraq, nuclear war, or other subjects. Some of the film to be shown include:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/?ref_=nv_sr_2\"><em>Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em></a>.

Its military strategy features hair-trigger escalation to nuclear war at the outset of any confrontation.\tIt has a very high threshold for the pain that economic sanctions inflict. Its nuclear weapons are now too numerous and well-hidden to be destroyed before they could be launched, so a preemptive attack on North Korea would likely involve very high costs.

In our sections you will also be asked to present to the NSC. As in a real NSC appearance you will  give a short presentation and then you will be questioned by an opinionated and perhaps skeptical panel that includes the  President of the United States and some  Cabinet officers. You should assume that the meeting is held in  tight secrecy. There is no point in playing to the cameras because there aren't  any. But you better impress the President or he/she might fire  you!</p><p>Your presentation will last five (5) minutes.\tIf you run over you may be cut off. Your presentation should include (1) an argument, and (2) supporting evidence or reasoning. Your TA and your fellow students will then pose questions and ask you to address counter-arguments, in role as NSC members. Be prepared to defend your argument with deductive or historical evidence. You choose the topic of your presentation.\tYou can make an argument that reacts to an issue raised in class or in the course readings, or you can address a subject of special concern to you. Your presentation can overlap with your paper topic.</p><p>We suggest that you bring an outline of your presentation and either hand it out or put it up on the blackboard, to help your audience follow your argument. We also suggest that you summarize your argument in a couple of sentences before marching through it.\tAgain, this makes you easier to follow. We recommend that you practice your speech a couple of times-to the mirror or, better still, to a friend-before giving it.</p><p>The NSC sometimes hears differing views in its deliberations.\tAccordingly we will try to organize presentations as debates between two members of the section who frame different views of an issue. Reminder: you are also required to provide your TA with a two-page (double-spaced) paper summarizing your talk, due on the day you speak.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Papers</h2><p>Students will write two short ungraded papers-a response paper that reacts to a course reading or lecture or class discussion, and a paper summarizing your in-section presentation-and two longer papers on questions arising from the course material. The two ungraded papers each will be two pages long, double-spaced. The longer papers will be 8 pages.\tOne 8-page paper assignment asks you to explain a past case of American conduct-what accounts for American behavior? A second 8-page assignment asks you to evaluate a past American policy: was the policy appropriate, or would another policy have produced better results? However, we are flexible about paper topics. You can negotiate your paper topics with us if you want to write on another subject.</p><p><em>Two Ungraded Papers</em></p><p>Your ungraded response paper is due by Session 8. Your ungraded talk-summary paper is due on the day you present your talk.&nbsp;</p><p>Your response paper should advance an argument about an issue raised by the reading, lectures, or section discussions, or about a foreign policy issue you care about. You can dispute or endorse argument(s) or theories advanced in the reading, lectures or section; or you can assess or explain policies or historical events mentioned in the reading or lectures. You are also free to advance an argument about a foreign policy issue or idea not covered in the class.\tWe encourage evaluation of policies or ideas. Are policies wise or unwise? Good or bad?\tAre policy ideas right or wrong?</p><p>Somewhere in your paper-preferably at the beginning-please offer a 1-2 sentence summary of your argument. Your paper should be about two typed pages (double-spaced) with standard one-inch margins on left, right, top and bottom.\tIt will not be graded but is mandatory and must be completed to receive full credit for class participation.</p><p>Your papers may be improved by keeping up with current international affairs during the semester.\tFour publications offer especially good international coverage: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\">The New York Times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">The Washington Post</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/\">Financial Times</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/\">The Economist</a> (a weekly).\tThe websites of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/\">British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/\">National Public Radio (NPR)</a> are also valuable.</p><p><em>Two 8-page Papers</em></p><p>Your first 8-page paper is due at the beginning of Session 17. Your second 8-page paper is due at the beginning of Session 23.</p><p>We require that you submit a finished draft of at least one of your 8-page papers eight days before its due date in order to get comments for rewrite from your TA. You are wise to submit both papers to your TA for comments.\tSo leave yourself time to get comments on drafts of the 8-page papers from your TA before you submit final drafts.</p><p>For detailed information on the graded papers, see <a href=\"./resolveuid/e051eeb751070e8350cd612e562c1b90\">First Paper Assignment</a> and <a href=\"./resolveuid/3ff7cc410befb9ee5efc9d3047fe99eb\">Second Paper Assignment</a>.</p><p><br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

(This list is not exclusive; other episodes are also allowed).</p><ol><li>United States policy before U.S. entry into World War I, and  /or U.S. entry into World War I, and / or U.S. conduct of World War I.</li><li>U.S. policy before U.S. entry into World War II, and / or U.S. entry into World War II, and / or U.S. conduct of World War II.</li><li>The U.S. decision to wage the Cold War.</li><li>U.S. strategies and tactics in the Cold War.</li><li>U.S. entry into and / or conduct of the Korean War.</li><li>U.S. conduct of the War on Terror, 2001&ndash;present.</li><li>U.S. decisions toward the Soviet installation of missiles in Cuba, October 1962 (the Cuban Missile Crisis). E.g., the U.S. decision to insist on the missiles's removal; or to pursue a blockade instead of bombing and invading.</li><li>U.S. intervention decisions, e.g., the U.S. decisions not to intervene in Rwanda in 1994; to intervene in Libya in 2011; to intervene in Iraq 2003; to intervene in Vietnam 1965.</li></ol><p>If the facts you need to fully assess your explanations are not found in the available course readings, describe what additional facts you would need to provide a more thorough assessment, and explain why these additional facts would shed light on the questions you address.</p><p>If you want to pursue a paper on another topic-for example, a paper that uses a case to test a theory of US foreign policy, or a paper that evaluates a US foreign policy-we are open to it. Consult your TA.</p><p>Your paper should be roughly eight typed double-spaced pages, with normal 1'' margins and normal-size typeface.</p><p>Start your paper with a short <strong>summary introduction</strong> that <strong>states your guestion(s) and distills your answer(s)</strong>. And offer a conclusion.</p><p>Your paper is due at the beginning of Session 17.</p><p>Your TA will give you feedback on a draft of your paper if you submit a draft a week before you submit your final  paper. You must do this for one of your two papers.\tYou are wise to do it for both papers.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

            "text": "<h2 class=\"subhead\">Final Exam Study Questions</h2> <p>You will be asked to answer <strong>two</strong> from a<strong> choice of three</strong> of these questions, plus some short identifications--probably six or seven from a choice of eight or nine.</p> <p>1) Write a memo to the President of the United States that frames the most serious threat now facing the United States and defines a strategy for addressing this threat. Use relevant history and evidence to support your arguments. In your answer, make reference to previous grand strategy concepts. If they still apply, say so; if they are obsolete, explain why.</p> <p>2) The Cold War witnessed sharp debates over American grand strategy for national security. What strategies were proposed during the Cold War? In retrospect, which strategy seems wisest?\tAnd did the U.S. choose wisely, or would a different strategy have produced better results? Offer an assessment of American strategy ideas and choices, using 20-20 hindsight and your knowledge of general principles of international politics.</p> <p>3) Robert Jervis outlines two contending explanations for international conflict: a &quot;spiral&quot; model, and a &quot;deterrence&quot; model.\tThe spiral model posits that conflicts arise from belligerent policies that unintentionally provoke hostility from others. In this view conflict is a self-fulfilling prophecy--states convert others into enemies by treating them as enemies.\tThe deterrence model contends that conflicts arise from failure to stand firm early against aggressors. In this view wars develop when status quo powers encourage aggressors to demand more by appeasing them. In the spiral view conflicts could be avoided by appeasing adversaries; in the deterrence view conflicts could be avoided by tougher policies.\tWhich model best explains the major wars and conflicts of the United States in the 20th century? What current policy prescriptions follow from your analysis?</p> <p>4) What was the worst American foreign policy blunder in recent history (since 1895)?\tExplain and defend your answer with reference to relevant history and ideas. Identify a feasible and superior alternative course of action; and explain what changes--that is, in identity of U.S. policymakers, in their ideas, or in the U.S. policy making process--might have permitted the selection of this superior alternative policy. Also mention several other U.S. blunders that you consider less serious and explain why.</p> <p>5) Discuss the effects of the nuclear revolution on U.S. national security interests and policies. Specifically: Has the nuclear revolution made the U.S. more or less secure? Has it mitigated any threats? Enlarged any threats? How has the nuclear revolution affected past U.S. policies? What current U.S. policies does the nuclear revolution call for? Specifically, what US policies does the nuclear revolution imply:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <ul>     <li>Toward China. Does the nuclear revolution call for more hard-line or more accommodationist US policies than if nuclear weapons had not been invented?</li>     <li>Toward Iran. How would Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons affect US interests in the Mideast and elsewhere?</li>     <li>Toward North Korea. What U.S. policies are called for by North Korea's ongoing expansion of its nuclear arsenal?</li> </ul> <p>Refer to relevant concepts and theories.</p> <p>6) What has been the net impact of the United States on the Third World since 1900?\tCritics paint the U.S. as an evil empire that fostered dictatorship, sparked war, and spread poverty in the Third World. They argue the best favor the U.S. could do the Third World today is leave it alone. Others claim the U.S. has been a white knight that spread democracy, peace, prosperity and justice in the Third World. Which view is closer to the truth?\tWhat current policy prescriptions follow from your answer? Should the U.S. pursue an active or isolationist policy toward the Third World today?</p> <p>7) What does the history of American intervention during the 20th century teach us about the likely results of a U.S. intervention in Syria to oust the Assad regime?\tDo you favor or oppose such an intervention?\tWhy?</p> <p>8) Write a memo to the President of the United States on how the U.S. should manage its future relations with China. Consider in your answer the possibility that China's economy will continue its rapid growth and China's economic strength will clearly surpass U.S. economic strength. Use relevant history and relevant theories (if any) to support your arguments.</p> <p>9) Discuss the size of the role of domestic factors in the making of past U.S. foreign policy. What domestic factors (ethnic lobbies, foreign lobbies, corporate lobbies, elite culture, popular culture, public opinion, ideology, etc.) have been most important?\tWhat important policies (if any) do they explain?\tDid their impact on policy advance or injure the national interest?</p> <p>10) Describe and evaluate U.S. counter-terror efforts since the al-Qaeda attack of September 11, 2001.\tWhat strategies were adopted? Which were wise and which unwise? Why?\tWhat lessons from history would help the U.S. develop better counter-terror policies?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
